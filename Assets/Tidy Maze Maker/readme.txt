Hello friend, and congratulations on your purchase of Tidy Maze Maker!

Tidy Maze Maker is an addon for Tidy Tile Mapper, allowing you to build Maze structures at Edit-time, and giving you access to Maze generation algorithms at runtime.

Installation instructions:

ANOTHER NOTE: If you are upgrading from a previous version of Tidy Maze Maker, please be sure to delete the DLLs that were previously
part of this package. (The Editor DLL in your Plugins folder, and the LevelGeneration DLL from this folder).

NOTE: Tidy Tile Mapper is required in order to utilise the Tidy Maze Maker user interface

1) Import the Tidy Maze Maker package
3) Navigate to Window > Tidy Maze Maker
2) Done!

Tidy Maze Maker behaves in much the same manner as the "Add Map" function in Tidy Tile Mapper.

In this case, populate your Map parameters, select your Maze type, and click "Generate Maze".

Your maze will be generated from your selected working block. If this is empty, it will use the first non-empty working block you have, from the swatch panel.

Note: For generating large mazes, this operation will take quite a while - as many many many blocks are being created. So go and get yourself a delicious coffee or other hot beverage - you've earned a break!

Once your map has been generated, the resulting map will behave in much the same was as any other map in Tidy Tile Mapper - you can publish it, or edit it as you see fit.

Enjoy!
